# Berlekamp-Massey-algorithm
A implement of Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. 

It can be used to infer the formula of a number sequence, especially in the competitive programming, 
since some kinds of problem in contests has only one or two integer inputs, and the C++ code that 
produces the sequence in complexity O(N) can be generated by the program automatically.

I used it to solve problem 1003 in the contest Astar 2017 online round 3 held by Baidu, and the data
to feed are generated by a naive brute force algorithm, since most of other people used complicated
dynamic programming method, which plays a important role in my advancing to the final.
